# Joomla! Feature / Specification RfCs
This repository is to provide a central place for RfCs for new
features for the Joomla! projects and Specifications (interfaces) for further 
development.

## Proposing a Joomla! Feature or a Joomla! Specification

To propose a Feature / Specification:

- fork this repo, create a branch, checkout that branch, add the Feature / 
  Specification RfC in `proposed/`, push the branch to Github, and send a pull 
  request; or,
- create a ticket to start a discussion on Github; or,
- start a conversation on the [CMS mailing list][joomla-dev-cms] for the CMS, the
  [Framework mailing list][joomla-dev-framework] for the Framework, or the
  [general mailing list][joomla-dev-general] for all other Joomla! projects.

[joomla-dev-framework]: https://groups.google.com/group/joomla-dev-framework
[joomla-dev-general]: https://groups.google.com/group/joomla-dev-general
@@@are all of these open to everybody ? if not we should mention

## GitHub usage

All discussion regarding a Joomla! Feature and Specification RfC happens on the 
mailing lists. Issues are used for bug tracking, and any RfC might not get appropriate
attention on the Issue Tracker.
@@@ i'm not comforable with this, in this way we- decouple the RFC from the discussion, i would much rather see a "Discussion" issue or something similar that is tied to the RFC but keeps everythin in one place

Please do not simply file an issue or PR and walk-away. The most likely outcome
is that it will not get seen or addressed in foreseeable time.

## Language and Translations

All Joomla! Feature / Specification RfCs are written in British English or American
English (Different RfCs may vary, but it is consistent within the same
specification). 
@@@ why offer a choice? joomla is en-GB, if we offer american english then we could as well have candian english or German
Joomla! does not offer official translations into other languages
but other external entities are free to translate the RfCs in accordance
with the license.
